To fix this, increase the specificity of the `.container p` selector. This can be done by adding a more specific parent selector or using the `!important` flag (though it's generally advised against using `!important` unless absolutely necessary). 

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container p {
  background-color: lightcoral; /* Fix: This will now override the less specific selector */
}

p {
  background-color: lightgreen; 
}
```

Alternatively, restructuring the HTML to avoid this conflict could be a cleaner solution.
