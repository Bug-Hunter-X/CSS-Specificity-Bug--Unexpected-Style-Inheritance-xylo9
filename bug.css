The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container p {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

p {
  background-color: lightgreen; 
}
```

In this example, all three selectors target paragraph elements within a `.container` div. However, the unexpected result is that the paragraph inherits the `lightgreen` background instead of the expected `lightcoral`. This happens because the selector `p` has higher specificity than `.container p`, overriding the more specific selector.
